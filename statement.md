# Project Statement

## 📝 Problem Statement
Managing student academic and personal records manually is inefficient, error‑prone, and time‑consuming.  
Traditional methods such as paper files or spreadsheets do not scale well and make it difficult to search, update, or organize information quickly.  
There is a clear need for a simple, desktop‑based application that can help store and manage student data efficiently with basic database operations.

This project aims to provide a **Java‑based Student Management System** with a GUI interface and MySQL backend to streamline the handling of student records.

## 🎯 Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:

- Designing a **Swing‑based GUI** for user interaction  
- Connecting the application to a **MySQL database** using JDBC  
- Supporting CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Providing additional utilities such as search and sorting  
- Displaying records dynamically using JTable  
- Maintaining data consistency and reliability  

Features such as authentication, advanced analytics, fee tracking, and attendance are **outside the current scope** but listed as possible future enhancements.

## 👥 Target Users
This system can be used by:

- **College administration staff**
- **School / college departments**
- **Teachers managing class records**
- **Students learning Java + MySQL integration**
- **Developers studying Java GUI and JDBC**

The application is primarily intended for educational and small‑scale institutional use.
